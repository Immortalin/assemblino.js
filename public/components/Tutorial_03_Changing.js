     Tutorial 03 - Changing objects and constraints properties

     1) To select an object to change it's properties you just need to click on them, regarding that when Connection Mode is enabled, the selection will
     happen only if you click on some Connector of the object. Without Connection Mode the object is selected by clicking anywhere on it.

     2) Once the object is selected it's properties may be changed by clicking <i>Interaction » Context » (object name) » Properties</i>. The pop menu will
      allow you to choose new values for some parameters. You can change the name of the component as well. After changing what you want, press Save.

     3) Changing a constraint can be done only with Connection Mode enabled. You need to click on the respective connectors, and then click
     <i>Interaction » Context » (object name, connector) » Change Connection</i>. Then you can alter the type, name and some other parameters of the
     constraint. As you choose different types of constraints a short explanation of the variables is displayed. When you are done click Save.

     4) Some constraint types have the option to display a GUI slider under <i>Interaction » Controllers</i>. This slider will change the angles for servos, rpm
     for motors, and position for linear motors.
