     Tutorial 01 - Connecting

     With this small tutorial you will learn how to connect components
     and how to use some modes in the Interaction Menu.

     1) To connect components, the checkbox - Interaction » Connection Mode - must be enabled.

     2) The spheres with axis on components are Connectors. They enable defining constraints between components,
     such as motors, servos, hinges and other type of constraints. When in Connection Mode you can click and
     drag components by clicking and dragging the Connectors. Try it!

     3) Now disable Connection Mode. Without this mode the components can be moved by clicking anywhere.

     4) Please turn Connection Mode on again.

     5) Go to Edit » Insert » public » Wheels and choose SimpleWheel. Name it myWheel and press Insert.

     6) Click on one of the wheels connectors and drag it towards the BASE, the gray platform, until the mouse cursor is on
     some connector of the BASE. Then release the mouse. The movement looks strange because the wheel seams not to follow the mouse; the important thing
     is that the mouse should be well positioned on the target connector when you release it.

     7) A pop menu should appear. Choose the type of connection: motor.
     Name it myMotor and press Connect.

     8) Now you can control myMotor by going to Interaction » Controllers » myMotor.

     9) You may change the size of Connectors going to Settings » World » Connector Radius
